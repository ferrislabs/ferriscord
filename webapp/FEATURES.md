## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Navigate to webapp directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ferrislabs/ferriscord/webapp
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Open browser** to `http://localhost:5173`

4. **Login with mock credentials**:
   - Email: `admin@ferriscord.com`
   - Password: `password`

## 🎮 Try These Features

### Navigation Flow
1. **Dashboard** → View server overview and recent activity
2. **Click on any server** → Navigate to server channels
3. **Select a channel** → Start chatting with mock messages
4. **Check member list** → See online users with status indicators
5. **Try direct messages** → Access private conversations

### Interactive Elements
- **Send messages** → Type and send in any channel
- **Server navigation** → Click server icons in left sidebar
- **User status** → See online/away/busy indicators
- **Real-time updates** → Mock WebSocket events every 5 seconds
- **Responsive design** → Resize browser to see mobile layout

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Performance Features
- **Lazy loading** ready for route-based code splitting
- **Optimized re-renders** with proper React patterns
- **Efficient data caching** with TanStack Query
